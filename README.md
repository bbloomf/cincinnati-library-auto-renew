# cincinnati-library-auto-renew
This is a project designed to run once a day and renew any books that a person has checked out from the Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County that are due at runtime.

Google App Engine
-----------------
It is designed to run from Google App Engine, and makes use of HtmlUnit to interact with the library's website.

Work in Progress
----------------
It is still very much a work in progress, and does not yet detect whether the renewal was successful.
